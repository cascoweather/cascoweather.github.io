  <h1>About CascoWeather.com</h1>
  <br>
  <h3>CascoWeather.com is intended to be a site where a visitor can find important information relevant to the community of Casco, Maine all in one place. I think all internet users share the frustrating experience of trying to find some basic information - like what time the sunset will be - and feel like you are on a wild goose chase and lost in advertisements. Additionally, I find I am often comparing many different forecasts - temperature predictions can sometimes range upward of 20&#176;F. By combining as many different weather forecasts as possible, along with interesting analysis of historical data, as well as data from my personal weather station, I aim to provide a comprehensive weather source with minimal clicking around on your part.  
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Additional  important information will be provided, including: sunrise/sunset times, golden hour times, traffic via Waze, water temperatures, drought conditions, stream flux, lake depth, soil information, air quality, water quality, links to local GIS maps/resources (potentially embedded into the website), historical information, and census information. Charts will be regularly and automatically updated.  Important gardening information like  agricultural zone, when to plant seeds/transplants indoors/outdoors, native species that are encouraged for your garden, last anticipated frost date, and more will be added for your gardening delight. Astronomical information like moon phase, nightly star chart, solar flare frequency, visible objects in the night sky are all hoped to be added.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Another goal is to allow town members to upload their photos of Casco, which will be randomly displayed as a Casco "Photo of the Day". We live in an especially scenic and photogenic community and it deserves to be shown off!  Other ideas for the website include an opportunity for users to report wildlife or plant spottings. This is useful for detecting invasive species, like the new Hammerhead worm, or noting when favorite migratory birds like the hummingbird return to town. It can also help key community members into their next hiking spot based on which forest flowers are currently blooming.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>If anyone in the town has historical documents, it would be great to get them scanned and uploaded here as a resource for the community.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>Finally, another goal is to provide community information that is currently only available via Facebook. Many resources in the communtiy seem to be only on Facebook - which makes it difficult to find out basic information like restaurant menus for those of us without Facebook.  I'd like to compile some local restaurants menus, add a free community bulletin board for advertising local businesses, and eventually a community forum to foster further discussion.

    <h2>This site is run and maintained by a resident of the town of Casco as a hobby project. My name is Emily, I'm a data engineer and I live in the woods near Crescent Lake with my family and pets. I started building this website as a learning experience and have found it a fun process so far.  I am eager to find ways to give back to my new community. Thanks for checking it out!</h2>
